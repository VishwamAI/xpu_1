# XPU Manager Rust

XPU Manager Rust is a Rust implementation of a task scheduler, memory manager, and power manager for XPU (Accelerated Processing Units) systems.

## Project Overview

This project provides a basic framework for managing tasks, memory, and power in an XPU environment. It includes:

- Task Scheduling: Prioritize and schedule tasks across multiple processing units.
- Memory Management: Allocate and manage memory for tasks.
- Power Management: Optimize power consumption based on system load.

## Installation

To use XPU Manager Rust, you need to have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed, you can get it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xpu_manager_rust.git
   cd xpu_manager_rust
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

## Usage

To run the XPU Manager Rust demo:

```
cargo run
```

This will execute a sample scenario demonstrating task scheduling, memory allocation, and power management.

## Usage Examples

Here's a basic example of how to use the XPU Manager Rust components:

```rust
use xpu_manager_rust::{TaskScheduler, Task, MemoryManager, PowerManager};
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut scheduler = TaskScheduler::new(4);
    let mut memory_manager = MemoryManager::new(1024);
    let mut power_manager = PowerManager::new();

    let task = Task {
        id: 1,
        priority: 2,
        execution_time: Duration::from_secs(5),
        memory_requirement: 200,
    };

    scheduler.add_task(task);
    memory_manager.allocate_for_tasks(&scheduler.tasks).unwrap();
    scheduler.schedule();

    power_manager.optimize_power(0.6);
}
```
