# XPU Optimizer

## Overview

XPU Optimizer is an advanced task scheduling and resource management system designed for heterogeneous computing environments. It leverages the power of XPU (Accelerated Processing Units) technology to optimize task execution across various processing units such as CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, and FPGAs.

## Features

- Multi-platform support (CPU, GPU, NPU, FPGA)
- Advanced task scheduling algorithms (Round Robin, Load Balancing, AI-driven Predictive)
- Dynamic memory management
- Cloud integration and distributed task execution
- Machine learning optimizations
- Energy efficiency and power management
- Scalability with cluster management
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Real-time performance monitoring and latency tracking

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xpu_optimizer.git
   cd xpu_optimizer
   ```

2. Install Rust (if not already installed):
   ```
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

4. Configure the optimizer (see Configuration section below)

5. Run the optimizer:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

## Configuration

The XPU Optimizer can be configured using the `XpuOptimizerConfig` struct. Key configuration options include:

- `num_processing_units`: Number of available processing units
- `memory_pool_size`: Size of the memory pool for task execution
- `scheduler_type`: Type of scheduling algorithm to use (RoundRobin, LoadBalancing, AIPredictive)
- `memory_manager_type`: Type of memory management strategy (Simple, Dynamic)

Example configuration:

```rust
let config = XpuOptimizerConfig {
    num_processing_units: 4,
    memory_pool_size: 1024,
    scheduler_type: SchedulerType::LoadBalancing,
    memory_manager_type: MemoryManagerType::Dynamic,
};
```

## Usage

1. Initialize the XPU Optimizer:

```rust
let mut optimizer = XpuOptimizer::new(config);
```

2. Add tasks:

```rust
let task = Task {
    id: 1,
    unit: ProcessingUnit::CPU,
    priority: 1,
    dependencies: vec![],
    execution_time: Duration::from_secs(1),
    memory_requirement: 100,
};
optimizer.add_task(task, "user_token")?;
```

3. Run the optimization:

```rust
optimizer.run()?;
```

4. Retrieve results and performance metrics:

```rust
optimizer.report_latencies();
optimizer.report_energy_consumption();
optimizer.report_cluster_utilization();
```

## Advanced Features

### Cloud Integration

The XPU Optimizer supports integration with cloud services for distributed task execution. To enable cloud integration, use the `initialize_cloud_services()` method before running the optimizer.

### Machine Learning Optimizations

AI-driven predictive scheduling can be enabled by setting the `scheduler_type` to `SchedulerType::AIPredictive`. This uses historical task data to optimize scheduling decisions.

### Power Management

Energy efficiency features can be configured using the `PowerManager` and `EnergyMonitor` components. Adjust power states based on workload using the `optimize_energy_efficiency()` method.

### Cluster Management

For scalable deployments, use the cluster management features:

```rust
optimizer.initialize_cluster()?;
optimizer.add_node_to_cluster(node)?;
optimizer.scale_cluster(target_size)?;
```
