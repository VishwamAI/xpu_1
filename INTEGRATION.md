# XPU Software Integration Process

This document outlines the software integration process for various processing units (CPU, GPU, TPU, NPU, LPU, FPGA, and VPU) within the xpu_1 project. It describes how these components connect and interact within the XPU ecosystem.

## 1. Overview

The XPU (Accelerated Processing Unit) system integrates multiple processing units to create a versatile and efficient computing environment. Each processing unit has its strengths and is optimized for specific types of tasks. The integration process ensures seamless cooperation between these units, allowing for optimal task distribution and execution.

## 2. XPU Manager

At the core of the integration process is the XPU Manager, implemented in Rust. It consists of several key components:

1. Task Scheduler
2. Memory Manager
3. Power Manager
4. Distributed Scheduler
5. Cloud Offloader
6. ML Optimizer

These components work together to efficiently allocate tasks, manage resources, optimize power consumption, and adapt to changing workloads across all processing units.
